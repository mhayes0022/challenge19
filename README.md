# PWA Text Editor

## Page Description

This application is a single page text editor that runs in the browser and meets the PWA (Progressive Web Applications) criteria. When you arrive at the website, you see a banner at the top of the display that reads "Just Another Text Editor". In the top left corner is a button labeled 'Install!'. When you click it, you are prompted to give permission to install the application locally. The majority of the page is taken up by the text editor itself, which is set to automatically on load display the letters 'JATE' using underscores, dashes, and slashes. You are able to erase this text if you so choose, or simply begin writing your text in the space above it. As you type, the application automatically loads additional lines to be able to fit your text.
